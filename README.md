# Hakathon2021
All the work done in Hakathon April 2021 with the topic: riscV
The occured in Ruppin Academic Center.
The mission was calculating fastest a multiplication of two 8-Dimensional given in 2 text files (in notepad).
We were required to show the result on any way we choose on FPGA DE1.
This competition was very difficult to me and my partner, because we didn't feel that we know what to do.
So we didn't finish the mission successfuly, unfortunately.

Next time, we will be ready!
